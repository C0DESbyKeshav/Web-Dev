<!-- Let’s break down each part of this HTML <head> section in simple terms with examples. -->

<!--
1. <head>...</head>
The <head> section of an HTML page contains important meta-information about the webpage.
It does not display anything directly on the webpage but provides instructions to the browser.
Example: If a webpage is like a book, the <head> is like the information on the book’s cover (title, author, etc.).    
-->

<!--
2. <meta charset="utf-8">
This line tells the browser how to read and display text on the webpage.
charset="utf-8" means the page uses the UTF-8 character set, which supports almost all languages and special symbols.
Example: If you want to display special characters like ©, €, ₹, or 中文, UTF-8 ensures they show up correctly.
-->

<!--
3. <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This makes the webpage responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes (like mobile, tablet, or desktop).
width=device-width: The page width will match the device’s screen width.
initial-scale=1.0: The zoom level starts at 100% (normal size).
Example: Without this, your webpage might look too big or too small on a mobile phone.
-->

<!--
4. <meta name="description" content="">
This provides a short summary of the webpage.
Search engines like Google use this to show a description in search results.
Example:
<meta name="description" content="A website about Keshav's projects and ideas.">
If someone searches for your site, Google might show:
"A website about Keshav's projects and ideas."
-->

<!--
5. <title>Keshav ka 1st website</title>
This sets the title of the webpage that appears in the browser tab.
Example: If your website is about recipes, you could write:
<title>Delicious Recipes by Keshav</title>
Where is it visible?
In the browser tab (top of the window).
In search engine results (like Google).
-->

<!--
6. <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
This connects an external CSS file (style.css) to the HTML page.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the design (colors, fonts, layout, etc.).
Example: If style.css contains:
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
Your webpage background will turn light blue.
-->

<!--
