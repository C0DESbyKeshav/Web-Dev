    <!-- * Box Shadows
    box-shadow is a popular CSS property that enables designers to add shadow effects around an element's frame.
    It can be used to give any element, be it a div, image, or button, a 3D feel or to emphasize on hover.
    
    box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;
    h-offset and v-offset: Determines the shadow's horizontal and vertical position.
    blur: The larger the value, the blurrier the shadow.
    spread: Expands or shrinks the shadow size.
    color: Defines the shadow color.
    inset: Makes the shadow inner. -->

    <!-- * Text Shadows
    text-shadow is utilized to give shadows specifically to the text.
    It can elevate the readability of the text or give it an elegant appearance.
    
    The Syntax for Text-Shadows is as follows:
    text-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur color; -->

    <!-- * Differences between Outlines and Borders:
    While both can visually appear similar, outlines differ from borders in a few ways:

    Position: Outlines don't take up space; they're drawn around the element, outside of any border.
    Offset: Using the outline-offset property, you can set the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.
    Width: Borders can have varying widths on different sides, outlines have a uniform width.
    Rounded Corners: Borders can have rounded corners using border-radius, while outlines generally cannot. -->
