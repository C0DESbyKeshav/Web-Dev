    <!-- *Entities in HTML:
            Entities enables you to display characters that are reserved in HTML or that aren't readily available on the keyboard. -->

    <!-- *Why Use HTML Entities?
            Here are some reasons:
            1. Reserved Characters: Characters like <, >, and & are reserved in HTML.
            2. Special Symbols: For symbols like Â©, Â®, or mathematical symbols.
            3. Non-Breaking Spaces: To create white spaces that won't break into a new line. -->

    <!-- *Common HTML Entities:
            &lt;  for <
            &gt;  for >
            &amp; for &
            &nbsp; for a non-breaking space
            &copy; for Â©
            -->

    <!-- Examples: -->
    3&lt;4: True
    <p>This is the paragraph tag &lt;p&gt;Entities&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    &amp;
    <p>This is a copyright symbol &copy;</p>
    <p>Dai&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sukiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Desu
        !!</p>

    <!-- These spaces and can also be obtained by using pre tag -->
    <pre>
        <p>Konichiwa</p>

        
        
        <h1>Aishteru ðŸ’“</h1>


As                    you                    can                        see, 
these lines are displayed after few new lines  and few spaces in the browser in the same way they are.
    </pre>


    <!-- *HTML Quotation Tags:
    In HTML, quotation tags are used to represent quoted or cited text.-->
    <h4>Quotes</h4>
    <!-- *1. <blockquote>
        For long quotations that are usually displayed as block-level elements (i.e., they start on a new line and are often indented). -->
    <blockquote>
        The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today.
    </blockquote>

    <!-- *2. <q>
        For short inline quotations. Browsers typically render this with quotation marks. -->
    <p>He said, <q>Practice makes perfect.</q></p>

    <!-- *3. <cite>
    To cite the source of a quote, book, article, or creative work. Usually used for titles of works. -->
    <p><cite>The Great Gatsby</cite> by F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>

    <!-- *4. title attribute (within quotation tags)
    Can be used with <q> or <blockquote> to provide additional context about the source. -->
    <q title="Albert Einstein quote">Imagination is more important than knowledge.</q>


    <!-- *Obsolete HTML Tags
    As HTML has evolved, some tags have been deprecated or become obsolete.
    While modern browsers might still support them, their use is discouraged in favor of CSS or more semantic HTML5 elements. 
    
    *Why Avoid Obsolete Tags?
    Compatibility Issues: Not supported by all modern browsers.
    Accessibility: This may not meet current web accessibility standards.
    Maintenance: Makes future updates difficult.
    
    *List of Obsolete Tags:
    <acronym>, <applet>, <basefont>, <big>, <blink>, <center>, <dir>, <font>, <frame>, <frameset>, <isindex>, <marquee>, <noframes>, <s>, <strike>, <tt>, <u>, <xmp>
    -->


    <!-- *Code Tag 
    The <code> tag is a semantic HTML tag that's used for displaying code snippets.
    It can be used both inline and within a block-level element like <pre>. -->

    <!-- *Why Use the <code> Tag?
    Semantic Meaning: Provides semantic value to the enclosed code.
    Readability: This makes it easier for both browsers and developers to understand that the text is code.
    Styling: Easier to style and highlight with CSS or JavaScript libraries like Prism. -->

    <!-- *Using <code> with <pre>
For multiline code snippets, it's common to combine the <code> tag with the <pre> tag: -->

    <pre><code>#include&lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello World";
    return 0;
}
    </code></pre>


    <!-- *What is a Character Set?
    A character set is a set of symbols and characters that a computer uses to represent text.
    In HTML, specifying the correct character set ensures that text is displayed properly across different browsers and platforms. -->

    <!-- *Why is it Important?
    Using the correct character set is crucial for:
    1. Accurate Rendering: To ensure that browsers correctly display your text.
    2. Multi-language Support: To display text in various languages and alphabets.
    3. Data Integrity: To make sure the data sent and received remains consistent.
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    -->

    <!-- *Common Character Sets
    Here are some commonly used character sets:
    UTF-8: Universal Character Set, 8-bit. It can represent any character in the Unicode standard.
    ISO-8859-1: Western Alphabet.
    ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange. -->


    <!-- *What is Canvas?
    The <canvas> element serves as a container for graphics, which can be rendered via scripting.
    Essentially, it offers a drawing area for visual content. -->

    <!-- *Why Use Canvas?
    Here are some reasons why you might use the <canvas> element:
    Graphics: For drawing shapes, graphs, and other visual representations.
    Dynamic Content: To dynamically update visual elements.
    Interactivity: Though this involves JavaScript, the canvas element is the foundation for interactive graphical content. -->

    <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
    <!-- won't show anything visible by itself because:
    The <canvas> element is just a blank drawing area.
    You need to use JavaScript to actually draw on the canvas. -->
