    <!-- The sizing units covered in this program is more than enough for creating websites.
    There's absolutely no reason to all the sizing units.
    But still if you want to, then check out this site for the comprehensive list of all the sizing units:

    <!-- pixel is 196th of an inch 
    In phone, vmin is the width because in phone the width < height
    In desktop, vmin is the height because in desktop the height < width -->

    <!-- * max-height: 80vh
    This means the box will always take the viewport height of 80% of the total heigth of the screen. -->

    <!-- * Percentage units
    width:50% 
    This element will be set to the 50% width to that of its parent element. 
    This does'nt works everywhere because it should have a parent element to inherit the size. -->
